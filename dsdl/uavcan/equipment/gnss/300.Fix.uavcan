#
# GNSS nav solution with uncertainty.
# Lat and lon are represented in integer degrees * 1e7, so 1 LSB = 1e-7 deg (approx. 11 mm per LSB on equator).
# Alt is above ellipsoid, represented as meters * 1e2, so 1 LSB = 1e-2 meters (10 mm).
# Velocity is in NED frame (north-east-down) in meters per second.
